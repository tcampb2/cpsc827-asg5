Project description: This is an extension of the 4th project. We are required to be able to do everything
from the previous project, and also be able to handle functions, if/else statements, and some boolean expresions.

In addition to those, my program also supports elif, the None value, and the words True and False as booleans. I
also made certain that there are no memory leaks (unless it crashes). I'm fairly certain it currently can handle
recursion as well, since I tried making an infinite loop and the program ended with a stack overflow. Also, rather
than only making a symbol table when a function is called, I create a symbol table when the functions are parsed,
and then create a copy of the symbol table once the function is called that is then deleted once the function ends.
This behavior allows me to recurse essentially for free.

The easiest part of this project: Actually making the node for the boolean expresions was practically trivial.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Getting functions set up and working was definitely the hardest
part. Once that was done, the rest of the project was much easier.
