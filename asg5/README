Project no: 4

Project description: The goal of the project is to edit the MyPy parser to handle integer
and floating point arithmetic, as well as assignment in the global scope. This is done
by creating an abstract syntax tree. This is to further familiarize ourselves with MyPy 
and to help prepare for when we must also include functions.

The easiest part of this project: Once I had the assignment operators and the expressions working,
the extra forms of assignment were trivial.

Problems that I had in completing this project: It took a while to figure out what each part of the parser did,
since we were looking at a different part of the parser than in the third project. It's a bit
weird to me how for, in, with, etc. are caught by the same rules that catch expressions in parentheses.
